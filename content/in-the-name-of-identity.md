- **Category:** Philosophy & Self
- **Author:** Amin Maalouf

## Why is this resource useful?

Provides meaningful and understandable rhetoric on what identity is, how it forms and why restricting yourself to a single/handful of identities hides your true self. Very insightful on societal pressure for people to be a certain way, and a simple read.
